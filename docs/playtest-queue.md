# Playtest queue

Changes that need in-Unity verification (Play Mode, single or multi-client) are **queued here instead of being tested immediately**. The user asks for the queue to be run when they are away ("run the playtest queue"). Results are written back into this file.

## Rules for the agent

### When finishing a change
1. Do the cheap checks now: compile, Console errors, EditMode/static checks that take under ~1 minute. Do not launch Play Mode or multi-client scenarios unless the user asks.
2. If the change needs a live check, add an entry under **Pending** (template below) in the same commit as the change when practical. Reference the destination commit SHA once it exists.
3. In the final message say "queued for playtest" and name the entry. Never write "verified" or tick a milestone/`docs/duckz-ports.md` item as validated for something that is only queued.
4. Omit `Mode` unless the entry should be report-only; fix-on-fail is the default.
5. If a later change invalidates a pending entry, edit or merge it. If an entry is superseded, move it to **Dropped** with a reason.

### When asked to run the queue
1. Verify Unity MCP targets Duck Rails, and that Unity compiles with an empty Console of new errors.
2. Work through **Pending** in order (cheapest/single-client first, multi-client later). Between entries, return Unity to Edit Mode and clear leftover test state.
3. Per entry: run the listed scenario, collect evidence (Test Center evidence under `Logs/Diagnostics/test-*`, `Temp/rails-*.txt`, Console excerpts), and record PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED with date, Unity version, client count, and the commit tested.
4. Do not stop on the first failure: continue with unrelated entries. **Fix on fail is the default** (an entry can opt out with `Mode: report-only`):
   - Diagnose, fix, recompile, and re-run that entry. Try at most 3 fix attempts per entry, then mark it FAIL and record what was tried.
   - Commit each fix separately on `main` (only the files changed, follow AGENTS.md), message naming the queue entry, so the user can review or revert each one. Never push.
   - Fixes stay within the entry's intended behaviour. If a fix would change a confirmed design decision, networking/boarding rules, or need a large new subsystem, don't apply it: record the failure and the proposed fix, and continue.
   - After a fix, re-run any earlier PASSed entries that touch the same code.
   - Record the failure, the root cause, the fix commit SHA, and the passing re-run in Results.
5. Move finished entries to **Results** (newest first) with evidence links, and update the matching docs (`docs/duckz-ports.md`, milestone checklist, feature docs) only for PASS.
6. Do not query diagnostic reports (see AGENTS.md).
7. At the end, give a short summary: counts of PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED and what the user must do (headset checks, anything not automatable).

### Not automatable (always stays manual)
Headset hand tracking and VR feel, real network jitter across machines, audio quality, anything marked `manual-only`. List these as **Needs human** in the entry; the run reports them but never marks them PASS.

## Entry template

```
### <short title> — queued <YYYY-MM-DD>
- Commit(s): <SHA or "uncommitted">
- Changed: <one line behaviour summary>
- Setup: <Test Center button / scenario / preset / block order, client count>
- Check: <what to observe; explicit pass criteria>
- Needs human: <headset/feel items, or "none">
- Priority: <low | normal | blocks other work>
- Mode: <fix-on-fail (default) | report-only>
```

## Pending

### Player walls and fall recovery — queued 2026-11-10
- Commit(s): uncommitted
- Changed: invisible ±48 m block side walls; local last-ground recovery below the kill floor or past a wall (no down); loose RailCargo below the kill floor is PhotonNetwork.Destroyed. See [player bounds](player-bounds.md).
- Setup: two clients on a normal route. Desktop client walks into a side wall on two different blocks. Then use a test teleport or fixture to drop each client below the floor: off the block ground, from the train while it moves, and twice within 6 s. Throw coal, a gold bar and a dropped bag below the floor (e.g. canyon or past a seam).
- Check: walls block walking and throws at |x| = 48 but not the track or seams. A fall returns the player within about 0.5 s to their last ground spot (train-relative if it was the train), with no down and no revive. A repeat fall steps further back. Items below the floor disappear on both clients with no Console errors or recovery retries. The victory ride still returns players aboard after 2 s. No new recurring allocations.
- Needs human: headset feel of wall contact and the instant warp; hand-climbing the invisible wall.
- Priority: normal

### Zombie hit shapes: in-game throws and swings (dcd2f9e1, 62ea1a73) — queued 2026-11-10, manual-only
- Commit(s): f073d29a4; fixture fixed in b76f4618f (automated part PASSED, see Results)
- Changed: zombie hit shapes follow animated bones (all five enemies); thrown items hit the earliest-contacted enemy; Spider head hit radius 23 cm.
- Setup: 1 client in Play Mode (headset preferred): throw/swing bat and gold bar at each enemy type, including crowded pairs and a locked (just-hit) zombie.
- Check: hits land on visible limbs/head; a throw hits the nearer of two zombies; deflect direction sane; held-swing feel unchanged.
- Needs human: all of the above (visual fit on animated enemies), throw and grab feel in headset.
- Priority: normal

### Enemy tuning + late-join flares: in-game (22262f75, 98ec9f5b, 6f4c3cba) — queued 2026-11-10, manual-only
- Commit(s): 1ea23d07f; fixture fixes 136fe60ea, 8005743a5 (automated part PASSED, see Results)
- Changed: speeds rebalanced, retreat 4–12 s, all zombies fear 40 s flares, flares restored for late joiners, smaller kill triggers, slower spider stalk.
- Setup: 2 real game clients: client A dies (flare), client B joins late, once on the ground and once aboard a moving train.
- Check: B sees the active flare with correct remaining life; enemies of every type avoid it; flare expires ~40 s. Known gap: flares are world-space, so one dropped on a moving train is left behind (not train-relative); record what B sees, do not treat as a fix target here.
- Needs human: speed/kill-trigger feel in headset; real-game late join (not covered by the batch fixture, which uses inert avatars).
- Priority: normal

### ZombieHook pull: no snapback, hands/gear clear of surfaces (6f27966d, 7b5dad14) — queued 2026-11-10, manual-only
- Commit(s): see git log "Port Duckz ZombieHook pull"; batch fixture re-run on HEAD 2026-11-10 PASS (see Results)
- Changed: hook pulls no longer snap the VR player back; while pulled, hands, held weapons/items and a hand-held bag stay out of floors and walls (locally and as sent to others), releases mid-pull drop instead of fling, and observers keep dropped items above the floor.
- Setup: 2 clients (A in headset). Force `RailHook` spawns. Pull A (1) on the ground near a wall, (2) standing on the moving train, including near the cabin walls/rear, (3) on a curve. Repeat with bare hands, nail bat, gold bar, and a hand-held bag; release the item mid-pull once inside and once outside the train cargo volume.
- Check: no rewind after the pull; no hand/bat/bag visibly inside geometry for A or B; train travel neither lost nor added; item released on the train becomes cargo and rides along, one released off it falls in place; B never sees a dropped bat tip through the floor.
- Needs human: headset hand/arm feel during and after the pull, comfort aboard the moving train.
- Priority: normal


## Results

### Queue run 2026-11-10 — automated portions (Unity 6000.3.24f1, batch, tested at HEAD 5b21d0009 + fixture fixes)
Run in the ignored disposable copies `tmp/duckz-port-validation` and `-2` (synced to `main`), separate batch processes. Manual/headset parts were not run and remain in Pending.

- **Zombie hit shapes — `GrabbablePlayChecks`: PASS** (1 process). Initially FAIL at "Actual grab": `PhotonMasterHandoff` exists in Play Mode and the unfocused batch process has no input focus (`handCanGrab=False avail=False`). Fixture-only fix `b76f4618f` grants focus as `ZombieHookPullChecks` does. Re-run passed: idle/moving held and thrown sweeps, frontmost forearm contact in both spawn orders, cooldown front lets rear take the hit, dormant/respawned Bomber. [Evidence](validation/playtest-queue/2026-11-10-grabbable-play-checks.txt)
- **Enemy tuning + late-join flares: PASS** (fixtures).
  - `DeathLifecycleChecks` (1 process): FAIL ×3 then PASS. (1) "Expired network event ignored": the port missed 98ec9f5b's second check hunk (30 s is no longer expired with a 40 s lifetime); fixed `136fe60ea` with the source expression. (2,3) `DuckHomeChecks` follow/conversation assertions: Rails `PhotonPlayer.ForActor` only resolves remote avatars with a received pose (d7ddf37db), the imported fixture never gave its players one. Fails identically when run alone, so it predates the port. Fixture-only fix `8005743a5`. No production code changed.
  - `SmasherRetreatJumpChecks` (1 process): PASS ("ALL PASSED"; `Run` does not exit by itself, process stopped after the pass).
  - `FlareJoinNetworkChecks` (2 batch editors, real Photon cloud): host and guest PASS: late join reconstructs both flares once with original launch time, RPC/property dedup, master leaves mid-smasher-fall and the successor lands it once while respecting the flare, flares survive the publisher leaving, independent expiry, expired deaths never replay. First attempt BLOCKED by the second copy failing its first-open package resolution; passed after warming it.
  - [Evidence](validation/playtest-queue/2026-11-10-enemy-tuning-flares.txt)
- **ZombieHook pull — `ZombieHookPullChecks` re-run on HEAD: PASS** (24 pull + 6 surface cases, same values as the port run). Everything else in that entry is headset/two-client. [Evidence](validation/playtest-queue/2026-11-10-hook-pull.txt)
